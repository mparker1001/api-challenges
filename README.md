Description
----
The api-challenges project is set of example scripts to assist end users with integrating their PHP based application 
with the the Rackspace Cloud API.

----
Prerequisites
----
These scripts assume that you have the latest php-opencloud libraries (found at https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud) 
installed to /usr/local/lib/php-opencloud and that the /etc/php.ini file has /usr/local/lib/php-opencloud configured in the
include_path directive.

These scripts also assume that your Rackspace Cloud credentials are configured in ~/.rackspace_cloud_credentials. A sample 
ini file named rackspace_cloud_credentials_sample has been added to this project for reference.
